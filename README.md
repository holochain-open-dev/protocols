# Holochain Open-Dev Protocols

Shared agreements about protocols to be used in open-source hApp development.

If we are able to agree on certain protocols/standards to be used in hApp development, we'll be able to integrate and compose different parts together and upgrade the sharing and reusability of our code.

## How to propose a protocol

0. Review carefully the existing protocols to see if some existing one already fits your needs. 
   - We prefer to have less protocols and more robust ones.
1. Carefully pick what category your proposal fits in.
   - Each category has its dedicated folder.
2. Clone the repository and add a `*.md` file describing your protocol.
3. Create a Pull Request and wait for feedback.
